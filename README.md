Unreal Engine Combat System Project
Overview
This project was developed using Unreal Engine, where I was tasked to implement various core features for a combat system, character health management, multiplayer support, and more. The project was assigned to me on 23 Jan at 5:30 PM and had a due date of 30 Jan. However, due to an Influenza attack on 26 Jan, I was advised by a doctor to take complete bed rest for two days. Despite this setback, I managed to complete most of the tasks within the given timeline.

Tasks Completed
Character Types:

Implemented two character types: Player and Enemy.
Integrated separate Health Components for both character types.
Combat System:

Implemented basic melee combat with a sword attack.
Defined attack methods for Melee, Ranged, and AOE (Area of Effect) attacks.
Completed logic for basic damage calculations.
Health Management:

Set up a health system that supports health depletion for both characters.
The health component is correctly linked and functions as expected for health reduction and updates.
Multiplayer:

Began the process of implementing multiplayer features.
Multiplayer synchronization for health and scores was outlined, but not fully integrated at this stage.
Character Animations:

Melee attack animations were defined, but sword attachment to character socket is not fully implemented yet.
Attack animations are set up but still require final tweaks to work properly.
Health Bar:

The health bar has been conceptualized, but it does not appear on screen yet. This is still pending for UI integration.
Pending Issues and Unfinished Tasks
Melee Combat Attachment to Socket:

The sword is not successfully attached to the character's hand socket. This is still an area that needs attention.
Attack Animations:

Animations for the attacks (especially melee) are defined but require adjustments for smooth play and proper synchronization.
Multiplayer Integration:

Basic framework for multiplayer was started, but features such as syncing actions between players (e.g., combat actions, health changes, etc.) are not fully functional yet.
Health Bar UI:

The health bar UI exists in the system but does not display on the screen as expected. Further integration with the UI system is required.
AOE and Ranged Attacks:

The AOE and Ranged attacks are partially implemented but need fine-tuning to apply damage and interact with enemies correctly.
Conclusion
This project was assigned with a tight deadline, and while a few setbacks affected the overall progress, I was able to complete significant portions of the required features. The remaining tasks are mostly related to fine-tuning and integration of UI and multiplayer components. Given more time, these features could be completed and polished further.
